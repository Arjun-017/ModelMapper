# ModelMapper
A comparison of different mapping techniques.
This repository demonstrates two approaches to object-to-object mapping in .NET:
 - Reflection-based Mapper – uses System.Reflection to map properties at runtime.
 - Source Generator-based Mapper – leverages compile-time code generation for fast and type-safe mapping.
